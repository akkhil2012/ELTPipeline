TOPIC 1: CHALLENGES IN MICROSERVICE
=============================================================
=============================================================
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/design/interservice-communication

GET , PUT , DELETE , HEAD , OPTIONS and TRACE are idempotent
challenges for microservices:
Resiliency
There are two design patterns that can help make service-to-service network calls more resilient:

Retry. A network call may fail because of a transient fault that goes away by itself. Rather than fail outright, the caller should typically retry the operation a certain number of times, or until a configured time-out period elapses. However, if an operation is not idempotent, retries can cause unintended side effects. The original call might succeed, but the caller never gets a response. If the caller retries, the operation may be invoked twice. Generally, it's not safe to retry POST or PATCH methods, because these are not guaranteed to be idempotent.

Circuit Breaker. Too many failed requests can cause a bottleneck, as pending requests accumulate in the queue. These blocked requests might hold critical system resources such as memory, threads, database connections, and so on, which can cause cascading failures. The Circuit Breaker pattern can prevent a service from repeatedly trying an operation that is likely to fail
===
Load balancing. When service "A" calls service "B", the request must reach a running instance of service "B". In Kubernetes, the Service resource type provides a stable IP address for a group of pods. Network traffic to the service's IP address gets forwarded to a pod by means of iptable rules. By default, a random pod is chosen. A service mesh (see below) can provide more intelligent load balancing algorithms based on observed latency or other metrics
===
Distributed tracing. A single transaction may span multiple services. That can make it hard to monitor the overall performance and health of the system. Even if every service generates logs and metrics, without some way to tie them together, they are of limited use
=========
Service versioning. When a team deploys a new version of a service, they must avoid breaking any other services or external clients that depend on it. In addition, you might want to run multiple versions of a service side-by-side, and route requests to a particular version
===========
TLS encryption and mutual TLS authentication. 
=============================================================
=============================================================



two basic messaging patterns that microservices can use to communicate with other microservices.

Synchronous communication. In this pattern, a service calls an API that another service exposes, using a protocol such as HTTP or gRPC. This option is a synchronous messaging pattern because the caller waits for a response from the receiver.

Asynchronous message passing. In this pattern, a service sends message without waiting for a response, and one or more services process the message asynchronously.

It's important to distinguish between asynchronous I/O and an asynchronous protocol. Asynchronous I/O means the calling thread is not blocked while the I/O completes. That's important for performance, but is an implementation detail in terms of the architecture. An asynchronous protocol means the sender doesn't wait for a response. HTTP is a synchronous protocol, even though an HTTP client may use asynchronous I/O when it sends a request

asynchronous messaging has some advantages that can be useful in a microservices architecture:

Reduced coupling. The message sender does not need to know about the consumer.

Multiple subscribers. Using a pub/sub model, multiple consumers can subscribe to receive events. See Event-driven architecture style.

Failure isolation. If the consumer fails, the sender can still send messages. The messages will be picked up when the consumer recovers. This ability is especially useful in a microservices architecture, because each service has its own lifecycle. A service could become unavailable or be replaced with a newer version at any given time. Asynchronous messaging can handle intermittent downtime. Synchronous APIs, on the other hand, require the downstream service to be available or the operation fails.

Responsiveness. An upstream service can reply faster if it does not wait on downstream services. This is especially useful in a microservices architecture. If there is a chain of service dependencies (service A calls B, which calls C, and so on), waiting on synchronous calls can add unacceptable amounts of latency.

Load leveling. A queue can act as a buffer to level the workload, so that receivers can process messages at their own rate.

Workflows. Queues can be used to manage a workflow, by check-pointing the message after each step in the workflow.

===================================================================
A service mesh is a software layer that handles service-to-service communication. Service meshes are designed to address many of the concerns listed in the previous section, and to move responsibility for these concerns away from the microservices themselves and into a shared layer. The service mesh acts as a proxy that intercepts network communication between microservices in the cluster. Currently, the service mesh concept applies mainly to container orchestrators, rather than serverless architectures.
Service mesh is an example of the Ambassador pattern — a helper service that sends network requests on behalf of the application


the main options for a service mesh in Kubernetes are linkerd and Istio
Features for ser mesh:
Load balancing at the session level, based on observed latencies or number of outstanding requests. This can improve performance over the layer-4 load balancing that is provided by Kubernetes.

Layer-7 routing based on URL path, Host header, API version, or other application-level rules.

Retry of failed requests. A service mesh understands HTTP error codes, and can automatically retry failed requests. You can configure that maximum number of retries, along with a timeout period in order to bound the maximum latency.

Circuit breaking. If an instance consistently fails requests, the service mesh will temporarily mark it as unavailable. After a backoff period, it will try the instance again. You can configure the circuit breaker based on various criteria, such as the number of consecutive failures,

Service mesh captures metrics about interservice calls, such as the request volume, latency, error and success rates, and response sizes. The service mesh also enables distributed tracing by adding correlation information for each hop in a request.

Mutual TLS Authentication for service-to-service calls.

Cor java questions:


1. strictfop in main
2. any other name than main???
       1. main can be overloaded; can be syncronized and can be called from child class
  JVM checks for the static block and static assignments before calling main()
  


3. Downcasting to byte or int
4. instanceOf example???

5. why we actually want to catch exception???

6. try catch finally finalize
  Isn't exception handling is a hack in java?
  exception handling using filenot found exception; so to use local file as alternative.
  
  empty stack in the rntime stack in destoyed by JVM just befpre terminating the thread.
  
  TO DO:
  OutOfMemoryException and StackOverflow are error
  
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-outofmemoryerror-exception-java/
  exception heirarchy??

  All errors are Unchecked
  
  Throwable in ath block ve Exeption vs Error
  
  Is it better to use throw new from actual method causing exception OR throws FROM CALLING METHOD????
  
  native keyword in java??
  
  
 throws keyword causes abnormale termination  
 throws is used for Checked exception and 
 
 why do interupptedexception is called explicitly on Thread.sleeep()
 
 should we throws exception from main method header???
 
 
 
 throws exception vs throws Throwable??
 
 run() vs Start()
 
 join() vs syncronized??
 Thread.join() waits for the thread to completely finish, whereas a synchronized block can be used to prevent
 two threads from executing the same piece of code at the same time.
 
 ThreadScheduler???
  the algo used vary fom JVM to JVM ; than why the scheduler is relevant to programmer??
  
 final static lock is equavalent to class level lock

BlockingQueue, ConcurrentMap, 
   Oder between producer and Consumer NOT maintained in Bloackingqueue?

1. cONCURRENThAHSmAP
      Bucket level locking is used instead of total map object lock BUT whats the limit of segement locking ?
	  n concurrent hashMap; a thread can mpdify the collection whil other thread is iterating But visibility not gaurantee.
	  
	  Another point of difference to note is that HashTable does not allow null keys or values whereas 
	  HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values. Since synchronizedMap is wrapper over HashMap, its behavior with respect to null keys and values is same as HashMap
	  ConcurrentHashMap is a segmented map, number of segments are based on concurrency level
	  
	  CopyOnWriteArrayList: clone of Map is made for every update operation and is sync later by JVM.
	  
	  CopyOnWriteArraySet vs synchronizedSet()???

	ContentRepository:
	 this repository utilizes the immutability and copy-on-write paradigms to maximize speed and thread-safety
	 conditions for archiving and/or deleting are configured in the 'nifi.properties' file
	 
	>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
	1. ContentRepository
	    FileSystemRepository
		"Resource Claims" 
		      These are Java objects that point to specific files on disk (this is done by keeping track of the file ID, the section the file is in, and the container the section is a part of
	 Repository Directoroies defined in  NifiProperties.java as; REPOSITORY_CONTENT_PREFIX
	 Content Claim:
	 To keep track of the FlowFile’s contents, the FlowFile has a "Content Claim" object.
	 concept of immutability is key to this being possible. Since the content is never changed once it is written ("copy on write" is used to make changes), there is no fragmentation of memory or moving data if the content of a FlowFile changes
	 
	 
	>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
   2. FlowFile Repository:
   FlowFiles that are actively being processed by the system are held in a hash map in the JVM memory.
   This FlowFile metadata includes all the attributes associated with the FlowFile, a pointer to the actual content of the FlowFile (which exists in the Content Repo) and the state of the FlowFile, such as which Connection/Queue the FlowFile belongs in. This Write-Ahead Log provides NiFi the resiliency it needs to handle restarts and unexpected system failures

   NiFi recovers a FlowFile by restoring a “snapshot” of the FlowFile (created when the Repository is check-pointed) and then replaying each of these deltas
   How do this checkpoint works???
   A snapshot is automatically taken periodically by the system, which creates a new snapshot for each FlowFile. The system computes a new base checkpoint by serializing each FlowFile in the hash map and writing it to disk with the filename ".partial"
   
    When NiFi goes down, the write claim for the change is orphaned and then cleaned up by the background garbage collection. This provides a “rollback” to the last known stable state.
	How GC works here????
	
	Write-Ahead Log means?????????????????????????? Which algo does NiFi uses??
	
   3. FlowFile:
   Its in 2 locations:
            First, in write ahead log and in-memory HashMap
	This hash map has a reference to all of the FlowFiles actively being used in the Flow. The object referenced by this map is the same one that is used by processors and held in connections queues. Since the FlowFile object is held in memory, all which has to be done for the Processor to get the FlowFile is to ask the ProcessSession to grab it from the queue.
         Is this same instance of FlowFile always???
   These FlowFiles are then removed from the hash map mentioned above and the connection queue is in charge of determining when to swap the files back into memory. When the FlowFiles are swapped out, the FlowFile repo is notified and it keeps a list of the swap files. When the system is checkpointed the snapshot includes a section for swapped out files. When swap files are swapped back in, the FlowFiles are added back into the hash map. This swapping technique, much like the swapping performed by most Operating Systems, allows NiFi to provide very fast access to FlowFiles that are actively 
   being processed while still allowing many millions of FlowFiles to exist in the Flow without depleting the system’s memory.	?????????

1.
Queues : Waiting List in Applications , Task Scheduling ,etc
========================================================================================================================


CMS CODE:

CustomAttributeServiceImpl.java
to do: 
1. to load locale sepcific messages
java.util.ResourceBundle


2. InvalidParameterException
to use generic exception

3. Template Pattern for CustomAttributeTemplate



4. testcase: AbstractCommonMetadataTest---------- starting point
    TestSuite is junit API ; its usecase as Test
	
5. Factory Pattern: SandboxClientFactory

6. transactional context for ISandboxClient.java???
What does this commen means:
This option can be set in the 'options' instance that is passed as an
 * argument to the various read methods. It should be noted that the use of
 * this option could increase the likelihood of contention between separate
 * transactions. Hence, this option should only be used when needed. Further,
 * this FOR UPDATE flag is 'sticky' in the context of EObject proxies that are
 * returned from the various read methods. That is, any proxy EObject returned
 * from a read method will use the FOR UPDATE flag value, that was specified when
 * the initial read occurred, when the proxy is subsequently inflated.
 
 7. ISandboxClient Hierarchy for: Value and ReadOnly operations
 
 8. Singleton Pattern: CommonMetadataServiceFactory.getInstance()
 
 
 9. cms.bootstrap.properties to load the porperies after initializing the services 
  to define the roles : com.ibm.iis.xmeta.cm.importRoles=CMAdmin
  
  =========================>>>>
  
  TASK 1:
     START FROM TESTCASE MTHOD: testCreateGraph() IN CommonMetaDataIdentityTest.java

9.1 ServiceException is the wrapper exception to cover the nested numerous exceptions for fatal irrecovable exception

 
 10. com.ibm.xmeta.client.tracker.XMetaChangeTracker( Adapter Pattern )
       that deals with maninting the changeSet for markForSave and markForDelete 
	

 11. Cache helper: ClientCacheHelper to deal with caching and phantomObjects??


   12. FullObject to update partiually or fully :
    updateChangeSet() in xmetaChangeTracker: uses check as instanceof


13. handleDiagnostic() method in XMetaEObjectValidator
     Uses Recursion


14. proxy pattern to inflate if Object is proxy: isProxy
getEObjectId() in EObjectUtils.java


15. SandBox client do:
  markForSave()
  
 16. UninitializedSandboxBinding.getInstance() : Used to check that the insteance pof sandbox is not usable
  Example of Singleton Pattern for thowing exception.
  The exception thrown explicitly.
  

 17. DefaultSandBoxClient for Cache usecase: Intercation of java backend with client cache
getClientCacheHelper() 
 implements IEObjectLookup that defines search using RID
 DefaultSandBoxClient is the implementation that has tracker; clientCache, and IDeleteRuleProvider
 // AbstractDeleteRuleProvider: implementation of IDeleteRuleProvider
 DeleteRule used as the Enum: Casecade, Restricted, NULL
 
 RepositoryClientConfiguration to load deleteRuleProvider
 AbstractChange is the changeSet; or the change made to eObject
 implementation is: ObjectTouched
 fetch the instance using SingletonPattern in java and add that as change in eObject

  changedObjects_ is Map of: <EObject, IChangedObject>
   Full Object change / partial object change based on instaceOf operator
   First check in cache list and than in PhantomCache
  
  
  18. checkPhantom() in IClientCache.java  ClientCache is the implementation
  IClientCache : is the cache in Client JVM???
   to sync client cache with object that is to be created; 
  
18.1
   Check for proxy : isProxy() an be done based on proxy state: be it PROXY or INFLATING
   XMetaEStoreState ENUM FOR STATE
   INFLATED IS DEFALUT STATE
   How is the eObject defined as Proxy or Non -Proxy???
   What do phatom Check : cacheHelper.checkPhantom(eobject); do????
   
   
   
   Adapter used notificatio Pattern:
   isObjectTracked in ClientCacheHelper check for lits of Adpter???
    List<Adapter> adapters = objectToCheck.eAdapters();// What are these adapters???
	Checks to see if the given object contains the change tracker 
	

   
   EObjectUtils.java:
   getEObjectId()

//RIDUtils.assignRidToEObject(null,eobject)
This part sets the RID to eObject. But why null???

trackChanges in ClinetCacheHelper allows to add changeTracker to list of Adapters

  
   19. ICache.java : Map?????
     SimpleCache.java is the implementtaion
	 Map of key and the EObject
	 
20. synchronized(map_) is used in 	  SimpleCache.java

21. Default SandBoxClinet.java save()
   Saves the collection of eobjects in the change set and deletes any objects in the delete set



22. try this case:
 If any EObject in the change set already exists in the repository it will be updated. It 
 
 sandboxClinet_markForSave works from bootom to up
 
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 Part 2:

 FeatureToggleConstants an importat enum class
 
 isFlushCacheAfterSave()??????
 
 repositoryBinding_.saveAndDelete: to save
 
 for now: saveAndDeleteEObjects only
 
 TransactionHelper.java used to maintain transaction to DB by SandBoxClinet
 
 InternalSaveAndDeleteEObjectsRequest.java
   Convert the reuest parametrs to the Internalrequest??? Why??
   
  use repositoryServiceSupport and SandboxOperations Constant to call execute method 
 
 RepositoryMethodDispatcher to dispatch all operations
 
 IAction are repository Action based on the parameters passed as operationType 
 
 TO DO: DispatcherInitializer??????
 
 DispatcherUtil.extractParameter to extract Paramter from Map
 
 AbstractSandBoxClinet.java:
 save
 
 IPersistence: CRUD Interface
 
 
 DeleteByRidController.java?
 
 
 passed as list of Actions; where order in mandatory to delete before update; thus no dangling reference occcurs
 
 has series of constructors that identifies the deleteClosure, than the intermedate tables,(all are constructurs)
 
 DeleteByRidContext is passed as context to all imple,entations execute() method
 
 
 prepareAndExecuteParametrizedUpdate() in SqlExecutor runs against the DB.. line 329
 
 BatchItemHandler is used to set parametrs to the placeholders
 
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Core SQl is pending.......
 
 
  Check for the Objects to be deleted:
  Map<EObject, DeletedObject> deletedObjects_ 
     * should be noted that only the EObjects in the change set are saved. EObjects that are 
	 
	 IDeleteAction is something that is implemented by all deletre actions
     * contained by EObjects in the change set are NOT saved (unless the contained EObjects are 
     * also in the change set).
	 
23. OptimisticLockException , SessionLockException etc are thrown at time of save()

24. XmetaTracker.java;  
public Set<EObject> getDeleteSet() {
        return Collections.unmodifiableSet(deletedObjects_.keySet());
    }
	
	 
25. XMetaChangeTracker.java:
changedObjects_.clear();
        deletedObjects_.clear();
        immutableSet_.clear();

call save only when the deleteSet and changeSet both are NOT empty

26. FeatureToggleContext :to set fro individual Thread; example of using ThreadLocal
    RepositoryClientConfiguration : example of syncronized SingletonClass; loading the client specific properties as ;
	Delete rules...
	
	
		
27. saveAndDelete() on ISandboxBinding passing the changeSet,deleteSet as parameters

28. InternalSaveAndDeleteResult is valueObject that returns the resultSet of saveandDelete

29.saveAndDeleteSerializedEObjects() 
Convert EObject to SerializedObjects
Convert the set of EObjects to serialized form

EObjectSerialization: the SerializedObject

Custom implementation to serialize a collection of {@link EObject}s into an
 * {@link EObjectSerialization} representation
30. EObjectSerializer

31. InternalSaveAndDeleteRequest is class that takes serializedObjects and pass it to DB

32. pass the parameters as Map of (SandboxOperations,request)

33. SandboxServiceSupport is support class to access repository

34. flushCache() ---> PersistenceBroker

35. RepositoryMethodDispatcher that executes against repository

3. IAction : interface used to make action against repository based on dispatcher

37.
result = action.doAction(context, parameters, repository_, modelRegistry_);

38. MethodDispatcherContext
  contextual state for repository operations based on the delgater / operation type
  
  >>> SaveAndDeleteEObjectsAction : implementation of the IAction
  the isolation of objects on client side and server side is isolated by client flusing the cache
  
39. IModelRegistry: to access the info from registry model at runtime???? use??

40. DispatcherUtil.extractParameter : to get parametrs from Map  

41. call sandBoxClinet save against public CRUD repository interface: IPersistence

42. DeleteByRidController.execute(context, conn, dbType); this do exact operation

queries
====================================
1.
UninitializedSandboxBinding.java
InvocationHandler??? How proxy is used and instance for client not initlialized??

2.
ISandboxBinding is used to bind SandBox CLient to SandBox service.

3.
repositoryBinding_ are two types:
      1. ERemoteBnding
	  2. UninitializedSandboxBinding
	  
4. PhantomObjectException is handled in IClientCache
Cache is created per session.
createPerSessionCache()
  -- SimpleCache is default implemenytation

If the eObject is a proxy, it will not be inflated???

XMetaEStoreEObjectImpl represents the proxy: 
How is a proxy defined in xmeta??



String rid = ClientUtils.getRidForObject(eobject);// rid is feteched from where???

The expectation from this question was to see how good is your object oriented design skills. You should always ask clarifying questions and do not make any assumption on your own. For this question, i wrote the code using OOP principles and a couple of design patterns

 LRU Cache
 
 System Design:
 design an ATM machine
 
 Given and array of seat allocations consisting of 1's and 0's (1 being occupied seats and 0 being empty), you need to put the next person in the best available seat. Best available seat is defined as a seat, which is at the maximum distance from its neighbours. Input will be an int, consisting of number of people to be seated, and int[] available and occupied seats array

I have been working for a data integration platform with offerings that helps to understand, cleanse, monitor and transform data.
Standardize approach to discover IT assets and define common business language for data across verticals and can define document and enact policies and rules and track data lineage
Build on unified metadata infrastructure that enables shared understanding between business and technical domains
A Common metadata Repository provides persistent storage for all IIS Suite components. All products depends on this repository to navigate .
uses the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) as the basis for it’s meta-model. This means that EMF is the modeling language that XMeta uses to implement the repository.
query and update metadata:
two kind of metadata:
    Dynamic: Includes design time information
    Operational: Audit; log data .
	
	You can create, manage and share a common business language, document and enact policies and rules and track data lineage. 
	Combine with Watson Knowledge Catalog (WKC) to leverage existing curated data sets and extend your on-premises IGC investment to the cloud
	

common metadata: 
   refers to data that can be produced and consumed by more than one application in the IS suite
   provide the basic data management operations needed by all applications (import, export, que-ryByIdentity, delete, etc ) in a consistent way
   exa:
	 •	Physical Data Resource (PDR) 
	 •	Business Intelligence (BI)
	 
	 An asset is represented as an object graph whose root is an instance of a class marked as an asset root in the model. 
	 An asset graph is inferred from a root object by applying the default asset closure rules associated with the model in the model registry
	 An asset can be referred to via its identity, which is analogous to the concept of a primary key for a relational table.
	 The identity of an asset is composed of the value of one or more attribute values from the asset root object and can also include the value of attributes 
	 from other objects that can be reached by following a reference from the root, 
	 as speci-fied by the identity definition associated to the asset root class
	 Common metadata services will be made available via POJO API and ISF role based se-curity constraints will be checked programmatically 
	 . Tools are expected to access common metadata directly using the XMeta sandbox only for read-only (XMQL) operations.
	 Identified by identity and closure rules.
	 
	 
	XMeta: A metadata Server eliminating the need for metadata import and export between tools
    Repository access via POJO
	Xmeta uses the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) as the basis for it’s meta-model. This means that EMF is the modeling language that XMeta uses to implement the
	repository.
	New models can be developed in tools like IBM Rational Software Architest (RSA) and processed/converted by XMeta Model Central
	XMeta provides a query interface which allows the retrieval of stored instance data based on criteria expressed in the XMeta Query Language (XMQL).
	
	EMF is an open source framework for defining models as sets of related packages, generating Java implementations of those packages, and 
	creating class instances within Java applications..
	A model is essential a UML class Diagram. 
	XMeta repositories provide a storage mechanism for models and EObjects. Once a given model is deployed to an XMeta repository, 
	EObjects which are instances of classes within this model  can be stored in the repository.
	XMeta leverages IBM Rational Software Architect as an UML editing environment and provides the Model Central tool to convert RSA models into EMF models.
	
	Has a proxy support:
	Specifying a proxy strategy can improve performance significantly, as only a subset of objects that are reachable from query result objects are actually 
	retrieved from the repository. All other objects in the returned object graph are proxies, which are lightweight representations of the underlying repository objects

2.
Tell us about a time you executed a new task or project?
Recruiters like to know how you solved problems you hadn't come across before. The best way to answer this question is to speak about a past project that involved significant learning. Big companies like Google look for candidates who can solve complex problems by applying sound logic and analytical thinking. If you found yourself in a situation where you successfully completed a project despite being unaware of certain functionalities at the start, mention your approach, how you implemented your learnings, and how you went about successfully completing it.

3.
hat are three things you consider important to maintain work-life balance?
The biggest tech firms in the world don’t want their employees clocking 18-hour work shifts everyday. In fact, they like to recruit smart workers who can employ critical thinking and solve problems innovatively without mental or emotional strain. To answer this question, think about 3 productive activities that bring you joy everyday, and why you’d like to do them despite having a busy work day. Talk about what you expect from your company to keep yourself energized and motivated when you come in the next day.

4.
Tell us about an accomplishment you’re particularly proud of and why?
Google hiring managers often ask candidates this question not because they want to know what they’ve accomplished, but why they’re particularly proud of it. To answer this question, think about a past project that involved dedicated efforts from other members of your team and how you achieved goals as a team. 


5.
How are you going to impact the team after you join?
Google has a detailed team-matching exercise in which candidates are matched to teams based on a variety of factors such as  skills, interests, hobbies etc. Recruiters at Google often ask this question to understand what candidates can bring to the table and map you to an appropriate team. To answer this question, talk about fun and interesting activities that you’d like to be part of or initiate. Recruiters are always on the lookout for dynamic individuals who can bring in tons of energy and motivation to the team.  



6.
Have  you ever faced conflict while working as a team? If so,  how did you deal with it?
Conflicts at workplaces aren’t uncommon and can surface every now and then, especially when working as a team. To answer this question, talk about how you were able to resolve a past conflict with a fellow colleague, and how you arrived at a consensus for the greater good of the project. 


7.
Why do you want to work at Google?
This is a common question recruiters at Google ask. The intention is to find out what excites you about working with Google, and why you’re fascinated with Google’s efforts to create a world driven by supremely innovative technology.
To answer this question, you can talk about your favorite Google products and what you like best about Google’s work culture.  

8.
Tell us about your favourite Google product and what you think about its future?
This is similar to the previous question. Here, you talk specifically about how a particular Google product absolutely fascinates, and perhaps, inspired you to interview at Google.
