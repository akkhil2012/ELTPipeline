 GO DEMO:


CASE1: DEFINE CHANNEL AND CONCURRENCY 
func CalculatePi(begin, end int64) <-chan uint


CASE 2: Example to show how many routines can be run
memConsumed := func() uint64 {



CASE 3:
Context switching between OS threads and goRoutines 
taskset -c 0 perf bench sched pipe -T


CASE4:
benchmark context switching:
BenchmarkContextSwitch
\\

CASE 4:
Mutex example for shared memory
sync.Once
Pool example 


CASE 5:
Example of Closed Stream and seperate in and out stream



CASE 6:
CHANNEL STATE AND RETURN TYPE.
range as alternative to NOT to read the default values from closed channel


CASE 7 :
example of go pipeline:
generator := func(done <-chan interface{}, integers ...int) <-chan int {


CASE 8:
or-Done, tee Channel



CASE 9:
Example of signal from parent to chil; to avoid go routine leaks




CASE 10:
error handling in go


CASE 11:
go pipeline
